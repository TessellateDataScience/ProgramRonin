# Project Ronin
## Summary
We would like to offer a learning program that teaches students how to develop sustainable businesses with less money. It will focus on the development of software development and application of this in producing a product/service that helps address a more socially-oriented problem while ensuring project survival. We believe our program teaches skills that are more needed going into the 21st century, unlike other institutions that focus on antiquated concepts.

## Program themes
Main themes covered in the program include: computational science, yourself and leadership, teamwork & effective collaboration, social entrepreneurship, fundraising & marketing. It will be aimed at self-directed learners, that focusses on female (or binary or other). This program will be run as an adjunct to other more 'formal' education, although no lower age requirement is set.

## Evaluation and development
Prior to offering the program we will evaluate it to ensure it is effective, against various metrics (to be determined). We will develop the program in consultation with a range of expertise from the various disciplines. We will develop the program via an iterative approach using 'design thinking' as a reference point. No point talking the talk without walking the walk.

## Influencers
We have some idea of the entities that we want to have influence within our program (more details below), as they have:  
- Missions that resonates with us.
- Learning content that is accessible/appealing to a wider audience.

### Influencer: Processing
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a digital sketchbook that promotes programming in the artistic community. It's developed using funding obtained from the Processing Foundation, which has a goal to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and work with code, especially those who might not have access to these resources.

### Influencer: OpenMM
[OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) is a toolkit for molecular simulation optimised for high-performance computing. Developed for use on a distributed network, we believe OpenMM could lead to lower-cost, more-equitable vaccine development that helps significantly more people while increasing the rates of innovation via more merit-based development.
